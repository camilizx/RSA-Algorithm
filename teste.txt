Ghost is a Swedish rock band that was formed in Link√∂ping in 2006.
They released a three-track demo in 2010, followed by the 7-inch vinyl
"Elizabeth", and their full-length album Opus Eponymous. The
Grammis-nominated album was widely praised and significantly increased their
popularity. Kerrang! included the album's song "Ritual" as one of "The 50 Most
Evil Songs Ever". Their major label debut Infestissumam was released in 2013,
topping the charts in Sweden, and winning the Grammis Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal 
Album. Their 2015 studio album Meliora reached number one in Sweden, and number
eight in the US. The lead single "Cirice" earned them the 2016 Grammy Award for Best 
Metal Performance.

Ghost is known for its eccentric on-stage presence. Seven of the group's eight
members, known as "Nameless Ghouls", wear virtually identical, face-concealing
costumes. Prior to a 2017 lawsuit filed by former members of the band, lead singer
Tobias Forge obscured his identity behind a succession of characters bearing the
title of "Papa Emeritus". Portrayed by Forge in a prosthetic mask and makeup, the
persona has been described as a "demonic anti-pope", and has undergone five
incarnations: I, II, III, Nihil, and IV. For the band's 2018 album Prequelle and
subsequent world concert tour A Pale Tour Named Death, Forge played a character
known as "Cardinal Copia", who is described as being unrelated to the prior Papa
Emeritus characters. Copia's costume consists of either cardinal vestments or a
black or white tuxedo; he also sports a prosthetic mask with black eye makeup and
multi-colored eyes, features which are present in each Papa character. At the final
Pale Tour Named Death show in March 2020, Copia was promoted to the title of
"Papa Emeritus IV", a persona Forge has continued for the 2022 album Impera and 
its associated concert tour, Imperatour.
